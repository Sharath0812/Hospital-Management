# Hospital-Management
A database that holds records of hospital from where details can be viewed, inserted and deleted
Database
The program is used for computerizing the working in a hospital to get information from the patients and then storing it in a MySql database for usage.  It is a better improvement over the manual system. The current system in use is a paper-based system and is too slow and cannot provide information required within a reasonable timeframe. The objective of this mini project is to reduce time and space.
